Hey man, 
 
It’s a good idea and I like it a lot and I’m happy to pass on my limited knowledge. 
 
Is this going to be as like a “hey LFF, let’s do some drills because I’m an FF2/3/QFF and have leadings soon”?
If so, it would be great for that, and maybe it’s layout should be more in a checklist format. 
So as the person doing the drill gives a wordback, or says a certain criteria, I can check them off on my list. At the end I can say ‘hey you did great (re:shit), but you forgot to say the patient’s age’ or something.
 
Essentially a huge PAGEBREW checklist tailored to the drill. RECEO always good to keep in mind too. 
P- Police (Give a reason.)
A- Ambulance. (Give a reason and patient description – age, m/f, (un)conscious? breathing?)
G- Gas Company
E- Electric company.
B- Stage one BA in operation.
R- Representatives (e.g. health dept., education dept.)
E- EPA
W- Work safe
 
Whereas I don’t think something like this already exists, I think the LFF emails are the best source/closest thing. I’ve attached a pdf which I think I’ve already sent you and on page 4-7 has all the 64 possible drills you will be asked of in the LFF course. Might be a good place to draw inspiration from. 
 
Hope my random ramblings have helped. Give me a call if you want to discuss some more.
