Hi Mate,

No problem at all, happy to help. Definitely keep asking questions of your OIC and also try and start thinking about decisions you would make when in their shoes. The experience and range of calls is as you say out of your control, but if you take off the blinkers and learn a bit at each call you will be heading in the right direction. Take care, talk soon.
