Hi Jas,

QFF’s already the job’s +@#$.

Mate I applaud your efforts in trying to get a training drill database together and prepare yourself for LFF. I have a few pieces of advice for you.

Firstly, you will find in asking guys that have recently done LFF’s that there are a list of the current drills doing the rounds.  You should be able to source them and rewrite them to a format that suits you if you so wish.

I tell you that hesitantly, because although I know that everyone sees them I don’t agree with it. My reasoning for that comes from my own experience doing my LFFs and SO course and as a panel member on LFF and SO courses. I believe it leads to choreographing of drills and effects the way that some people learn to be an OIC. It’s a bit like the learning to pass your driver’s licence vs. the learning to drive scenario. Although your template doesn’t strictly do that it sort of starts you heading in that direction.

I totally understand that different people have different learning styles and some want to see things written down and have a step by step procedure for every incident that we attend. I personally don’t think that is possible and you are better off to have a system of work that you can apply to every scenario. I will briefly run you through mine and am happy to talk to you about it in detail, or runs some drills  for whoever is interested at a time closer to you going to the college.

So very briefly my theory on going for your LFF.

•	Crew Safety is the overriding principle – it must always be front of mind
•	Don’t treat it as a tick box exercise so that you are passing a test. Treat it as an opportunity to learn a system that will work for you in any scenario. For example as a panel member, I’ve seen candidates calling for workcover before getting water on the fire. Would this ever happen in the real world.
•	Your  FFing skills must be excellent, so that you can confidently correct your crew if they are making unsafe decisions or going outside of SOP’s
•	Patient care must happen quickly and be maintained until handed over to AV
•	Information gathering is critical, gather information THEN give your crew clear instructions on what you want them to do.
•	Size up is also information gathering and a good size up will naturally lead you to a great position from which you can control your drill
•	Step back/ blinkers off – stay out of the drill as much as you can, you will see much more.
•	RECEO, RECEO, RECEO – use it, tick it off in your mind as you go and if you ever get stuck refer back to it. Where am I at, what do I need to do next.
•	PAGEBREW is important but not as important as getting water on the fire or sending a wordback .

So a very simplified flow of a drill/call for me would be 

1.	Turnout, time of day, what local knowledge do I have, listen and analyse further info
2.	On scene, water availability, siting, construction, basic instruction to crew,  comms to VKN8
3.	Information gathering, witness, size up
4.	Dynamic risk assessment , First strategic decision, RECEO, instructions to crew. Ie we have a rescue to perform they were last seen in …, be aware gas and power haven’t been isolated
5.	If anyone is injured or missing AV
6.	Wordback decision – obvious smoke and fire, people missing – get the gear on the road. Less obvious or serious don’t be afraid to use your investigation time. For example a dumpster up against a shop could have transferred heat inside  and you could have fire extension and could call it a  Structure fire 2nd alarm straight away. But if you put water on the bin and the exposure, and get crews with breaking gear to check inside with a TIC it could just as likely be non-structure fire under control.
7.	SItRep – paint a picture of what you are seeing for oncoming crews/CMDR not just what you have but where you are in RECEO and job allocation if you have specific needs. E.g. we have a single story weatherboard house well alight 20x15 m all persons accounted for exposures in sectors 2 & 4 teleboom to come straight to sector 1 to set up to cover exposure in sector 4. Straight away everyone knows where we are up to in the job and what our next priority is.
8.	Messages can be sent at any time but don’t let the distract you from watching your crews and if something more important comes up forget about the message and send it later. Go through PAGEBREW to make sure you have covered everything 
9.	Reassess another dynamic risk assessment has anything changed for the worst are my tactics working
10.	Prepare to hand over control – SMEACS 


Hopefully that’s enough to get you started, as I said I’m happy to talk  at length about it whenever. Use whatever format you want and that works for you but remember your focus is on command and control and crew safety try not to get caught up on the details of doing each specific ffing task in writing up your template and I certainly wouldn’t be writing up 90 odd drills I would just look at a command and control model that would fit any incident.

Cheers Dicko
